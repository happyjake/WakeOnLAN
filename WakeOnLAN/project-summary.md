# Wake On LAN Android Project Summary

## Project Structure

We've created a complete Wake-on-LAN Android app that follows test-driven development:

1. **WakeOnLan.kt** - Core class that implements the Wake-on-LAN functionality
2. **MainActivity.kt** - UI implementation that uses the WakeOnLan class
3. **WakeOnLanTest.kt** - Unit tests for the WakeOnLan functionality
4. **MainActivityTest.kt** - Unit tests for the MainActivity

## Test Implementation

We wrote tests first that verify:
- MAC address validation
- Magic packet creation
- Packet sending
- UI interactions

## Core Functionality

The app:
1. Takes a MAC address and broadcast IP from the user
2. Validates the MAC address format
3. Creates a "magic packet" with:
   - 6 bytes of 0xFF
   - 16 repetitions of the MAC address
4. Sends the packet to the broadcast address on port 9
5. Reports success/failure to the user

## How to Build

To build and create an APK in Android Studio:
1. Open the project in Android Studio
2. Select Build > Build Bundle(s) / APK(s) > Build APK(s)
3. The APK will be generated in app/build/outputs/apk/debug/

## Testing

All tests should pass, verifying that:
- MAC address validation works correctly
- Magic packet creation follows the correct format
- Network operations are performed correctly
- UI handles user input appropriately

## Extensibility

The project is structured to be easily extended:
- The WakeOnLan class can be used outside the MainActivity
- SocketFactory interface enables testing with mock network components
- Clear separation between UI and network logic
